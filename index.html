    our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.</p><p>we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous. actually who are you not to be.</p> we were born to make manifest, the glory of <strong>God</strong> that is within us, and as we let our own light shine, we <em>unconciously </em>give other people permission to do the same!
